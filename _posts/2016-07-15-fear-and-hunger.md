	"He started smelling the air. His mind starts working and guessing the scene. He is invisible in the jungle with his yellow and black striped fur. He started moving step by step towards the source of the smell.  His walk was very low and firmly.  His rippling muscles show his intention. There he got the first view of his food, a healthy, meaty deer. He was hungry since last few weeks. He stopped near a thick green bush and charging himself for the attack. It was a perfect hiding spot for him. Deer has no idea about this beast. she was just too busy drinking water.  

	Tiger was patiently waiting for right moment. Suddenly there was a change in wind flow. Deer got the smell of the tiger. He became alerted. His flagged tail showed that he was alert now. In a matter of time, there was a strike.
Tiger jumped and dug his throne sharp nails into deer’s thighs. The jungle surrounded by the grunting of the poor deer. He took down the deer with all his heavy body weight and tried to rip with his razor sharp teeth. But he missed it. 

	Deer managed to escape from the big heavy jaws of tiger and started running. Tiger also moved quickly and started chasing the deer. he didn’t want to miss this chance to get the food. He knew if he missed this, It will be very hard to get next one. He started following the deer with more aggression."


This is an everyday situation in the jungle but the lesson to learn here is _"Jungle is full of danger and uncertainty, so do our lives. We must find the motivation to keep running. Deer’s run is motivated by fear. She fears of the tiger. She has a fear of death. If she stops running, she might lose her life. On the other end, tiger’s run was motivated by hunger. If he doesn't run then he might not get the food."_


__Fear and Hunger is an important part of our life. Fear helps us to survive and saves us from danger.  While hunger motivates us to do things, achieve our goals.__

Question to ask yourself is __“Do we like a deer who live her life in fear, running and hiding from situations because of the fear of failure?”__
If we choose this path to leave our lives, we will survive. But what’s the fun in it?

_Be like a tiger, Live your life motived by hunger. Hunger of knowledge. Hunger of success._ 
    
Stay hungry, Keep running!!
