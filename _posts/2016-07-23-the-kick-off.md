Yesterday I had a chat with my wife. She is more into Yoga thing and wants to build a career in that domain. We discussed the opportunities, pros and cons and other related stuff. We agreed on all the discussed thing. But she has only one doubt.
"How to get started?". Like her, many of us have the same confusion. We all have something in mind which we want to start, but we hesitate to do so. Getting started is the hardest part. Following are some reasons why are we hesitate to kick off the things, and tips to overcome them.

## 1. Fear

At some point in life, we all have some kind of fear which blocks us to getting started. Fear of failure, rejection is the key reason not to try something new. And It holds us back from achieving our goal, move us forward. It limits our thinking process and distracts our mind.

To overcome from fear, Write down the worst thing that happens if you fail. Are you going to die? Are you going to jail? Will you live your life in misery? Will you not able to speak with your friends and family? Just write down the worst case scenario. Sometimes, the failure is very negligible or you are avoiding it because of only it's not your comfort zone. You may try for the second effort. So think about the effect of failure in your life and try to overcome.

If you are afraid of the results, detach yourself from the results. Don't think about the outcome. Just do it.

The second thing you can try is to go for bravery training. Put yourself forcefully in a situation which you tried to avoid at the first place. For example, if you are afraid of giving a presentation, whenever your boss asks for the volunteer for next presentation, please register yourself. Like other training, This bravery training trains our mind to tackle the fear.

## 2. Low self-esteem or self-confidence
Low self-esteem stops us from taking any action. It blocks our future. There are a number of reasons for low self-esteem, like poor academic performance, social issues, poor finance condition, bad habits, etc.

- Develop the mindset to believe in yourself.
- Forget about the past. The Past is gone, aim for the future.
- Ditch the bad habits

## 3. Lack of resources and time
Many of us say that they don't have the time or enough resources/finance/time and it is the blocking point for them.

Rethink of resources. Ask yourself, do you really need that? Most of the time we can start the things with limited resource and later we can upgrade. For example, to start a video channel on youtube you only require one good camera. If you don't have a professional camera, studio lights, mic, etc still you can start it. Later you can upgrade your equipment.

For financial help,
- Check with your parent, friends who will happy to invest into your product/idea.
- For large help, look for the incubator or soft banks.

If time is the constraint. Make a proper schedule and follow it. Stay focused.

## 4. No or limited Knowledge
This is may be one of the genuine reason for not getting started.

You can overcome this limitation very easily. In today's world, we have the technology which provides information at our fingertips. Use the technology to gain more knowledge.
- Read blogs, listen to the podcast, watch the video.
- Hang with the mastermind groups.
- Enroll yourself in training.
- Take help of an internet. People are always happy to help you.

## 5. Waiting for right time
People think this is not the right time. I should wait for the right moment to kick off the things. But that right time never comes.

There is nothing like right time. Start working on your idea now. Take the control of your game from this moment only. The sooner you start, the more advantage you will get.

__That's all for now. Stay focused and hit it hard.__
